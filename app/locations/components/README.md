# Locations components

- `LocationsClientWrapper.tsx` orchestrates filters, grid and map modes.
- `LocationsMap.tsx` renders the hotspot intelligence map (fetches `/api/locations/hotspots` with fallback to provided locations).
- `LocationsFilter.tsx` keeps filter controls aligned with URL search params.

Update this document whenever new discovery surfaces are added to the locations page.
