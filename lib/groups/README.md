# Organizer group services

This module collects group-focused service helpers that power the organizer console and related management tooling. The
`organizer-console.ts` entry point orchestrates membership tier CRUD, sponsorship slot workflows, and higher level data
aggregation for the `/groups/manage/[slug]` route.
