# Home Components

`HomePageClient.tsx` renders the marketing hero, personalized spotlight, and sport category sections on the landing page.

## Sections

- **Hero**: Static storytelling that adapts call-to-actions based on authentication state.
- **Personalized Spotlight**: Uses `PersonalizedHomeContent` to surface recommended groups, events, and spotlight sports.
- **Category Explorer**: Iterates through `sportsCategories` to highlight curated content for each taxonomy bucket.

Update this document whenever the homepage layout or data contracts change.
