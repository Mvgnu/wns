- Task: Launch Monetized Event & Membership Commerce as the flagship revenue track.
- Hypothesis: Completing Stripe checkout activation, organizer revenue consoles, and dispute automation in phased milestones will unlock sustainable paid event revenue while informing future engagement investments.
- Log:
  - 2025-10-31 01:05 UTC: Selected Monetized Event & Membership Commerce as the flagship track and defined phased milestones, dependencies, and KPIs in the Product Roadmap.
  - 2025-10-31 02:10 UTC: Shipped authenticated Stripe checkout session endpoint with idempotent creation logic and automated tier sync, unlocking milestone progress for Checkout Activation.
  - 2025-10-31 03:05 UTC: Connected Stripe webhook processing to Prisma memberships so checkout completions, invoices, and subscription cancellations update billing status with Stripe identifiers.
  - 2025-10-31 04:05 UTC: Synced Stripe-driven membership states to legacy `GroupMemberStatus` gating so paid activations unlock private surfaces and delinquencies revoke access consistently.
  - 2025-10-31 05:10 UTC: Captured Stripe payments in a revenue ledger with organizer earnings API surfacing group summaries and recent transactions for the commerce console.
  - 2025-10-31 06:05 UTC: Enabled organizer coupon catalogs with Stripe promotion code sync, checkout validation, and revenue-ledger redemption tracking.
  - 2025-10-31 07:05 UTC: Logged Stripe refunds and disputes with audit tables and chargeback ledger entries, progressing the Dispute & Refund Automation milestone.
  - 2025-10-31 08:05 UTC: Delivered organizer payout scheduling, manual payout requests, and coupon catalog surfaces powering the Organizer Revenue Console milestone.
  - 2025-10-31 09:05 UTC: Wired Stripe payout webhooks into Prisma so `GroupPayout` statuses, transfer references, and schedule timestamps reflect settlement outcomes with event-level idempotency.
  - 2025-10-31 10:10 UTC: Added organizer-facing dispute queues with action logging backed by `GroupPaymentDisputeAction`, closing the loop between Stripe evidence deadlines and internal finance workflows.
  - 2025-10-31 11:05 UTC: Wired Stripe payment success events to membership receipt emails with notification dedupe, confirming checkout and subscription charges for members automatically.
  - 2025-10-31 12:05 UTC: Enforced membership tier capacity limits in checkout with organizer console telemetry so oversubscribed tiers block new purchases while honoring renewals for existing members.
  - 2025-10-31 13:05 UTC: Automated membership tier upgrades and downgrades by canceling superseded Stripe subscriptions once replacements activate, preventing double billing while keeping Prisma membership states accurate.
  - Progress: Tiered membership fulfillment milestone â€” 2/3 deliverables complete (member caps and automatic subscription transitions shipped; gated content enforcement outstanding).
