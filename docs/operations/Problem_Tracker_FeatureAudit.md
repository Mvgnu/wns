# Feature Audit Tracker

## AUD-001 Organizer Console Resilience Refresh
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Scope:** Organizer monetization console loading and error experience.
- **Evidence:** `app/groups/manage/[slug]/page.tsx` rethrows unknown exceptions after handling `GROUP_NOT_FOUND`/`UNAUTHORIZED`, producing blank screens for transient Prisma or network faults.
- **Next Steps:** Add structured error boundaries, telemetry logging, and optimistic loading indicators for membership tier mutations.
- **Logged:** 2024-05-23
- **Log:**
  - 2025-10-31: Organizer console expanded with revenue dashboards, coupon management, and payout scheduling; resilience improvements still pending.

## AUD-002 Group Chat Realtime Hardening
- **Status:** IN_PROGRESS
- **Scope:** Group chat SSE stream stability and failure messaging.
- **Evidence:** `components/chat/GroupChatPanel.tsx` closes the `EventSource` on error without reinitializing, so live updates stall after the first disconnect and message failures keep `sendingMessage` stuck true.
- **Next Steps:** Implement exponential backoff reconnection, surface connection status UI, and reset pending state on failed POSTs.
- **Logged:** 2024-05-23
- **Log:**
  - 2024-05-23: Added exponential backoff reconnection with offline alerts, message failure toasts, and connection-state tracking in `GroupChatPanel`.

## AUD-003 Onboarding Validation & Telemetry
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Scope:** Onboarding wizard error feedback and API instrumentation.
- **Evidence:** `components/onboarding/OnboardingWizard.tsx` funnels validation failures into a single banner and uses non-abortable fetches, leaving users without per-field guidance or insight into latency spikes.
- **Next Steps:** Add client-side validation with inline field errors, wrap fetches in abortable controllers with timeout handling, and capture success/error metrics.
- **Logged:** 2024-05-23

## AUD-004 Analytics Scalability & Visualization
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Scope:** Operator analytics data access patterns and presentation.
- **Evidence:** `app/admin/analytics/page.tsx` loads the full 30-row history on every request and renders tables without charts or baseline comparisons.
- **Next Steps:** Introduce paginated/segmented APIs, lazy table loading, and sparkline visualizations with threshold alerts.
- **Logged:** 2024-05-23
